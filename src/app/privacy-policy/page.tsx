          <strong>Disclosure to Our Business Partners</strong>

        <p>
          We work with various types of third-party business partners to offer
          you our Cash Back shopping Services. We may disclose the following
          types of information with the following types of Business Partners:

        <p className="text-xl mt-6">
          <strong>Affiliate Partners</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          When you click on a link to a merchant site presented on our Services
          to start your Cash Back shopping, you evidence your intent to interact
          with that business through our Services, and thereby are directing us
          to disclose certain information about you (including the link you
          clicked in our Services and a unique ID assigned to track that your
          shopping originated from our Services) to an affiliate network to
          properly account for your purchases with a merchant. For a small
          number of merchants that do not utilize an affiliate network, this
          information is provided directly to the merchant. The Affiliate
          Partner will collect Internet and Network Activity information about
          your use of our Services in relation to the merchant site, products,
          or offers. Our Affiliate Partners collect this information to track
          the shopping trip, but some of them may also use this information to
          measure performance, contribute it to their own user profiles and/or
          combine it with information they collect elsewhere, which they may
          make available for use by their other business clients. In such cases,
          our disclosure to certain of these Affiliate Partners could be
          considered a "sale" or "sharing" of your personal information as those
          terms are defined under applicable U.S. state privacy laws, and the
          opt-out we offer to consumers in Section 5, below, would signal these
          Affiliate Partners to not collect or use your information from our
          Services except as necessary to validate and provide your Cash Back.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, to the limited extent that we target direct marketing to
          you or personalize the offers you see in our Services based on the
          profile data we compile from your behavior tracked via our Services,
          for the direct benefit of a particular merchant, this marketing or
          personalization may also be considered "selling", "sharing", or
          processing for the purposes of "targeted advertising" of your personal
          information. In this circumstance, the opt-out we provide in Section
          5, below, would cover this type of targeted marketing and
          personalization. We may use information we collect about you in
          combination with information about you from current and prospective
          merchant partners to test and analyze how our Services help merchants
          and business partners. The information we disclose to and receive from
          a merchant or business partner to effectuate this analysis may include
          online shopping identifiers (such as shopping ID's, order ID's), a
          hashed email address, and Commercial Information (such as whether a
          purchase was made and the corresponding order value). We may use the
          results from these tests in an aggregated and deidentified manner to
          improve our Services and to market our Services to merchants and
          business clients. You may opt out of our disclosure of your
          information to these certain third parties for this purpose in
          accordance with Section 5, below.

          your Cash Back shopping from third-party sites where you learn about
          our Services, we contract with certain referral marketing business
          partners to enable that functionality, which may require that we
          disclose certain data about you to them. For example, if you are
          referred to our Services from a business partner's websites, we may
          provide that partner with information about your sign up to validate
          the referral and activate your Services account access from the
          partner's site. In addition, we may disclose information about whether
          you have made a purchase with us recently and whether you have
          installed our mobile app or browser extension so that the partner can
          personalize their email and site content to you. This information
          disclosure about your behavior in our Services may be considered
          "selling", "sharing", or processing for "targeted advertising" under
          applicable U.S. state privacy laws, so we provide an opt-out
